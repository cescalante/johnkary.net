I am available for hire as a contract web application developer. [Please get in touch!][] I have lots of experience leading small teams, and love helping developers learn new things, like how to collaborate effectively with git or migrating a legacy codebase to a modern web stack.

I have worked mostly in the higher education and trucking industries but am always looking for new interesting fields! I attend and [speak][] at a few local user groups, including being Co-Organizer of the [Kansas City PHP User Group][], and also help drive the language-agnostic [Lawrence Coders][] group.

### My favorite tools

-   PHP
-   Symfony2 framework and components
-   git
-   JavaScript
-   WebKit inspector
-   NetBeans IDE
-   vim
-   Terminal
-   MacBook Air

### University of Kansas

Before becoming a contractor, I worked as the Technical Lead/Senior Programmer for the Web Services group within Information Technology at the [University of Kansas][]. I started there as a part-time student web developer in Fall 2004, hired as a full time programmer in January 2007, and assumed a the technical lead role in August 2010.

That group is the primarily web development group on campus, responsible for implementing the University's [public-facing web presence][] and developing custom web applications for both IT and various departments. The group is regularly sought for consulting and advice from various smaller development shops on campus, including hosting and facilitating the monthly campus-wide KU Web Developers meeting.

### RapidHire

Since 2007 I have been the lead PHP application developer for RapidHire: a truck driver recruitment management software company based in the Denver, Colorado area.

At RapidHire, I have developed a web application system allowing truck drivers to input their extensive job application data and digitally sign their job application and legal documents, all in their browser. The system generats PDFs of all documents, including digital signature on all application materials, providing a fully digital job application workflow. This system allows RapidHire's customers to instantly screen and approve driver applicants without faxing or mailing legal documents to be signed and returned by the driver.

We deploy on an IBM AS400/i5 environment using DB2 and Zend Server instead, of a traditional LAMP stack.

### The Beginning&hellip;

I [got my start in web development][] as a hobby in 1998 on [Chris
Escalante's][] parents' dining room table. Chris and I are still very
good friends and continue to collaborate to this day.
